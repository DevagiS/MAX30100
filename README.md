# MAX30100 Project

This project uses an ESP8266 and a MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter sensor to create a web dashboard for real-time heart rate and oxygen saturation monitoring. It allows users to view their health metrics in real-time through a web interface.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Arduino IDE installed.
   - ESP8266 board package installed in Arduino IDE.
   - MAX30100 sensor connected to ESP8266.

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/DevagiS/MAX30100.git
     ```
   - Open the project in Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Edit the configuration file to add your WiFi credentials.

## Usage

After setting up the project, follow these steps to use it:

1. **Access the Web Dashboard:**
   - Connect your computer or mobile device to the same network as the ESP8266.
   - Open a web browser and go to the IP address assigned to the ESP8266.

2. **Viewing Data:**
   - The dashboard will display real-time heart rate and oxygen saturation levels.
   - Data can be monitored and analyzed from the web interface.

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter issues, check the serial monitor for error messages and ensure all connections are secure.
